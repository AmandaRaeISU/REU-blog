## Directions:

Write a summary of what you learned at the CSAFE All-Hands meeting this week. You can organize the post however you'd like (by topic or by day, for example), but it should have at between 300 and 800 words. 

## Instructions:
Save a **copy** of this file, replacing "Lastname" and "Firstname" with your own and *leave the original unedited*.

In **your copy**, replace the `title:` and `author:` fields in the YAML above, while leaving the remaining fields intact. Remove the background and the instructions sections and write your blog post!

Once you are done, **create a pull request** to upload your changes to the original repository!
