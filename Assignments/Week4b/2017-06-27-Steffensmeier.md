## Background:

Revisit the [case study](https://www.unh.edu/research/sites/www.unh.edu.research/files/docs/RIS/lacour_case.pdf) on `When contact changes minds` and the surrounding problems. Revisit the questions you chose to answer. Read two of your peers' responses as well. Be sure at least one of the questions they asnwered is different from the questions you answered.

For your two questions, plus one question from each of the two peers you selected, (for a total of four questions), discuss the following: *In what way(s) can GitHub help address the issues which these questions raise?

## What data management issues does this case raise? (Maddie Quistgaard)
	
Some issues that arisen were that the data was tampered with to make the outcome of the results be astonishing and unique to the point that it was significate. The data management should have been looking for discrepancies that had occurred in the data instead of letting the researcher do everything on their own without getting verified about all the work done. There was lack in control and verification in the research which laid to the retraction of the research. 


## Why didn’t the peer review system identify the problems? (Macy Neblett)

The peer review process entails experts of that area of science reviewing the new study. Perhaps because these “results” seemed so revolutionary, the reviewers were eager to have evidence contrary to older studies. For example, people used to believe that the Earth was the center of the universe. It wasn’t until Copernicus’ controversial model of heliocentrism that a scientific effort was made to prove this idea that went against people’s preconceived notions. Perhaps the reviewers thought along these lines; that maybe with the changing times, people’s attitudes were also changing. 

## How do you think LaCour was able to publish falsified data in such a prestigious journal as Science?

LaCour's timing with his "findings" could not have been more perfect. I think that his false claims brought hopes back into people's hearts and minds that everyone isn't always "stuck in their old ways"; a little bit of talking and educating can completely change someone's political beliefs despite what old studies suggested. *Science* saw the graduate student and his well accredited accomplice, Dr. Green, and just assummed that their data was falid. LaCour even went as far to say certain foundations funded their research in order to make the research sound even more valid. Given the timing of the study and the false assurances LaCour provided, I can see why *Science* may have made the mistake in assuming that it was a reliable study. To be the magazine that publishes a scientific study that proves people aren't as stubborn minded about homosexuals and that change is possible is a huge publicity booster. While *Science* is a very distinguished magazine, they are a for profit magazine and money is not always out of the question when publishing research articles. I think they saw this as an opportunity to get more readers and took it. 

## What are the responsibilities of individuals who co-author papers? What can or should a student (graduate or undergraduate) do when co-author is suspected of falsifying data?

Individuals who co-author papers are generally supposed to help gather data with the primary author and other co-authors. To elaborate on that with this study in particular, they would survey the randomly selected 10,0000 participants and enter in their data. They would also help evaluate the data and help with the interpretations. This is based off of what my sister does as a graduate researcher here at Iowa State. If a student suspects that a co-author has falsified data, first, they should come forward to another person (professor or student) and tell them of their suspicions. Getting a second opinion is crucial because your curiousities could be stemmed from a biased perspective. If they also believe that is falsified, I believe directing your concerns to those involved with the study is the next step. Ask them how they did their study and what detailed procedures they followed to collect their data (the procedure should already be published, but hearing it from the source is always best). If they comply and tell you how the reserach was done, then using your judgement will come into play; turning it into IRB I think would be the best way to go if the data still seems suspicious.
