## Background:

As we start thinking about the statistics and science of forensics this summer, consider [this podcast](http://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/theres-less-science-in-forensic-science-than-you-think/), from Science Friday a few weeks ago. 

Does what the guests on the show say surprise you? If you were being tried for a crime, would you have faith that the evidence would be weighed fairly and honestly? Based on their commentary, what forms of evidence do you think hold up to scrutiny, and which do not?

Do you think the criminal justice system is living up to the idea of "innocent until **proven** guilty"?


## Instructions:
Save a **copy** of this file, replacing "Lastname" and "Firstname" with your own and *leave the original unedited*.

In **your copy**, replace the `title:` and `author:` fields in the YAML above, while leaving the remaining fields intact. Remove the background and the instructions sections and write your blog post!

Once you are done, **create a pull request** to upload your changes to the original repository!
